# LeadDork - Automated Lead Generation Tool

##  Features

* **Modern UI:** High-end Glassmorphism interface with dynamic lighting effects and physics-based micro-interactions.
* **Dual Mode:**   **Midnight Cyberpunk:** Deep violet/navy gradients for focus.
      **Spring Glass:** High-contrast, energetic gradients for daytime use.
* **Persistent Storage:** Automatically saves your search history and favorite queries to a local SQLite database (hidden in AppData).
